    <abstract>
      <t>This document discusses considerations for assigning a new
      recommended DiffServ Code Point (DSCP) for a new standard Per Hop Behaviour (PHB). It considers the common
      observed remarking behaviours  that the DiffServ field might be subjected to along
      an Internet path. It also notes some implications of using a specific
      DSCP.</t>

    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>The Differentiated Services (DiffServ) architecture has been deployed
      in many networks. It provides differentiated traffic forwarding based on
      the DiffServ Code Point (DSCP) <xref target="RFC2474"></xref> carried in the DiffServ field <xref target="RFC2474"></xref> of the IP packet header.</t>

      <t>DiffServ associates traffic with a service class <xref target="RFC4594"></xref>, and
      categorises it into Behavior Aggregates <xref target="RFC4594"></xref>. Configuration guidelines for service classes are provided in <xref target="RFC4594">RFC4594</xref>.
      Behaviour aggregates are associated with a DiffServ Code Point (DSCP), which in turn maps to a Per Hop Behaviour (PHB). 
      Treatment differentiation can be
      realised using a variety of schedulers and queues, and also by
	    algorithms that implement access to the physical media.</t>

      <t>Within a DiffServ domain, operators can set service level
   specifications <xref target="RFC3086"></xref>, each of which maps to a particular Per
   Domain Behaviour (PDB) that is based on one or more PHBs.  The
   PDB defines which PHB (or set of PHBs) and hence for a specific
   operator, which DSCP (or set of DSCPs) will be associated with
   specific BAs as the packets pass through a DiffServ domain, and
   whether the packets are remarked as they are forwarded.</t>

      <t>This document discusses considerations for assigning a new DSCP for a standard PHB. It
      considers some commonly observed DSCP remarking behaviours that might be
      experienced along an Internet path. It also describes some packet
      forwarding treatments that a packet with a specific DSCP can expect to
      receive when forwarded across a link or subnetwork.</t>

      <t>The document is motivated by new opportunities to use DiffServ
      end-to-end across multiple domains, such as <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-nqb"></xref>, proposals to build mechanisms using
      DSCPs in other standards-setting organisations, and the desire to use a
      common set of DSCPs across a range of infrastructure (e.g., <xref
      target="RFC8622"></xref><xref target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-nqb">,</xref>,
      <xref target="I-D.learmonth-rfc1226-bis"></xref>).</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Terminology">

      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL"
in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 <xref
target="RFC2119"/> <xref target="RFC8174"/> when, and only when, they appear in
all capitals, as shown here.</t>

      <t>DSCPs are specified in the IANA registry <xref target="DSCP-registry"></xref> where a variety of different formats are described.  
A DSCP can sometimes be referred to by name, such as "CS1", and
        sometimes by a decimal, hex, or binary value. Hex values are represented in text using prefix 0x. Binary values use prefix 0b.
       </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Current usage of DSCPs">
      <t>This section describes current usage of DSCPs.</t>

      <section title="IP-Layer Semantics">
        <t>The DiffServ architecture specifies the use of the DiffServ field in
        the IPv4 and IPv6 packet headers to carry one of 64 distinct DSCP
        values. Within a given administrative boundary, each DSCP value can be
        mapped to a distinct PHB <xref target="RFC2474"></xref>. When a new PHB
        is standardized, a recommended DSCP value among those 64 values is
        normally reserved for that PHB, and is assigned by IANA. An operator 
        is not formally required to use the recommended value;
        indeed [RFC2474] states that "the mapping of codepoints to PHBs
        MUST be configurable." However, use of the recommended value is
        usually convenient and avoids confusion.</t>

        <t>The DSCP space is divided into three pools for the purpose of
        assignment and management <xref target="DSCP-registry"></xref>. The
        pools can be summarised in a table (where 'x' refers to either a
        bit position with value '0' or '1').<list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="DSCP Pool 1:">A pool of 32 codepoints with a format
            0bxxxxx0, to be assigned by IANA Standards Action <xref
            target="RFC8126"></xref>.</t>

            <t hangText="DSCP Pool 2:">A pool of 16 codepoints with a format of
            0bxxxx11, reserved for experimental or local (private) use by

            This was initially available for experimental or local use, but
            was originally specified to be preferentially utilised for
            standardized assignments if Pool 1 is ever exhausted.

            target="RFC4594"></xref> 
	    had recommended a local use of DSCP values 0x01, 0x03, 0x05 and 0x07 
	    (codepoints with the format of 0b000xx1).    
	    Pool 3
            codepoints are now utilised for standardized assignments and are
            no longer available for assignment to experimental or local use <xref
            target="RFC8436"></xref>. <xref
            target="RFC8622"></xref> assigned 0x01 from this pool and consequentially
	     updated <xref
            target="RFC4594"></xref>. Any future request to assign 0x05 
		would be expected to similarly update <xref target="RFC4594"></xref>.</t>

          </figure>

</t>
        <t>The DiffServ architecture allows forwarding treatments to be
        associated with each DSCP, and the RFC series describes some of these
        as PHBs. Although DSCPs are intended to identify specific treatment
        requirements, multiple DSCPs might also be mapped (aggregated) to the
        same forwarding treatment. DSCPs can be mapped to treatment
        aggregates that might result in remarking (e.g., <xref
        target="RFC5160">RFC5160</xref> suggests Meta-QoS-Classes to help
        enable deployment of standardized end-to-end QoS classes)</t>

      </section>

      <section title="DSCPs used for Network Control Traffic">
        <t>Network Control Traffic is defined as packet flows that are
        essential for stable operation of the administered network (see <xref
        target="RFC4594"></xref>, Section 3). The traffic consists of
	the network control service class and the OAM service class.
	This traffic is marked with a
        value from  a set of Class Selector (CS) DSCPs.
	This traffic is
        often a special case within a provider network, and ingress traffic
        with these DSCP markings can be remarked.</t>

        <t>DSCP CS2 is recommended for the OAM (Operations, Administration,
        and Maintenance) service class (see <xref target="RFC4594"></xref>,
        Section 3.3).</t>

        <t>DSCP CS6 is recommended for local network control traffic. This
        includes routing protocols and OAM traffic that are essential to
        network operation administration, control and management. Section 3.2
        of <xref target="RFC4594">RFC4594</xref> recommends that "CS6 marked
        packet flows from untrusted sources (for example, end-user devices)
        SHOULD be dropped or remarked at ingress to the DiffServ network".</t>

        <t>DSCP CS7 is reserved for future use by network control traffic.
        "CS7 marked packets SHOULD NOT be sent across peering points" <xref
        target="RFC4594"></xref>.</t>

	<t><xref target="RFC2474">RFC2474</xref> recommends PHBs selected by CS6 and
        CS7  "MUST give packets preferential forwarding treatment by comparison to
        the PHB selected by codepoint '000000'".</t> 

        <t> At the time of writing, there is evidence to suggest CS6 is 
	actively used by network operators for control traffic. A study of 
        traffic at a large Internet Exchange showed around 40% of ICMP traffic 
	carried this mark <xref target="IETF113DSCP"></xref>. Similarly, another 
	study found many routers remark all traffic except those packets with a DSCP
	that sets the higher order bits to 0b11 (see Section 4 of this document).</t>

      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="observed-remarking" title="Remarking the DSCP">
      <t>It is a feature of the DiffServ architecture that the DiffServ field
      of packets can be remarked at the Diffserv domain boundaries (see section 2.3.4.2 of
      <xref target="RFC2475"></xref>). A DSCP can be remarked at the
      ingress of a domain. This remarking
      can change the DSCP value used on the remainder of an IP path, or the
      network  can restore the
      initial DSCP marking at the egress of the domain. The DiffServ
      field can also be remarked based on common semantics and agreements
      between providers at an exchange point. Furthermore, <xref target="RFC2474"></xref> states
      that remarking must occur when there is a possibility of theft/denial-of-service attack.</t>

      <t>The treatment of packets that are marked with an unknown or an
unexpected DSCP at DiffServ domain boundaries is a matter of
administrative policy and outside the scope of <xref target="RFC2474"></xref>.
If packets are received that are marked with an unknown or an
unexpected DSCP by a DiffServ domain interior node, <xref target="RFC2474"></xref>
recommends forwarding the packet using a
default (best effort) treatment, but without changing the DSCP.
This seeks to support incremental DiffServ deployment in existing networks
as well as preserve DSCP markings by routers that have not been
configured to support DiffServ. (See also <xref target="remark"></xref>).

     <xref target="RFC3260"></xref> clarifies that this remarking specified by RFC2474
   is intended for interior nodes within a DiffServ domain. For DiffServ ingress nodes the
   traffic conditioning required by RFC 2475 applies first.
</t>

      <t>Reports measuring existing deployments have categorised DSCP
      remarking <xref target="Custura"></xref> <xref target="Barik"></xref>
      into the following seven observed remarking behaviours:</t>

          <t>ToS Precedence Bleaching (/Bleach-ToS-Precedence/) is a practice
          that resets the first three bits of the DSCP field to zero (the former
          ToS Precedence field), leaving the last three bits unchanged (see section
          4.2.1 of <xref target="RFC2474"></xref>). A DiffServ node can be 
	  configured in a way that results in this remarking. This remarking 
          can also occur when packets are processed by a router that is not configured 
	   with DiffServ (e.g., configured to operate on the former ToS precedence field 
           <xref target="RFC0791"></xref>). At the time of writing, this is a common 
           manipulation of the DiffServ field. The following Figure depicts this remarking.</t>

        <t>A network device might remark the DiffServ field of an IP packet

	Section 3 of <xref target="RFC2474"></xref> recommends: 
	"Packets received with an unrecognized codepoint SHOULD be forwarded as if

	should not be changed."  Some networks might not follow this recommendation 
	and instead remark packets with these codepoints to the default class, CS0 (0x00). 
        This remarking
        is sometimes performed using a Multi-Field (MF) classifier <xref

    <section anchor="lowerlayers" title="Interpretation of the IP DSCP at Lower Layers">
      <t>Transmission systems and subnetworks can, and do, utilise the
      DiffServ field in an IP packet to set a QoS-related field or function at
     the lower layer.  A lower layer could also implement a traffic conditioning
     function that could remark the DSCP used at the IP layer.  In many cases, this
      use is constrained by designs that
      utilise fewer than 6 bits to express the service class, and therefore
      infer mapping to a smaller L2 QoS field, for example, the 3-bit PCP field in an IEEE Ethernet 802.1Q header, the 3-bit WiFi UP field or
      the 3-bit Traffic Class field of Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS).      
      A Treatment Aggregate (TA) <xref target="RFC5127"></xref>

        traffic class. The remaining values indicate increasing priority.
        Internet control traffic can be marked as CS6, and network control is

        <xref target="IEEE-802-1D"></xref> maps both PCP1 (Background) and

	<t> Most current WiFi implementations <xref target="RFC8325"></xref> use a default mapping that maps the first three

	(which could be seen as a simple method to map IP layer DiffServ to layers offering only 3-bit QoS codepoints). Then, 
        in turn, this is mapped to the four WiFi Multimedia (WMM) Access
        Categories. The Wi-Fi Alliance has also specified a more flexible mapping 
	that follows RFC8325 and provides functions at an AP to remark packets as

        value). This derived DSCP value is used for QoS treatment between
        the wireless AP and the nearest classification and marking policy
        enforcement point (which may be the centralized wireless LAN
        controller, relatively deep within the network). Alternatively, in the

	  <t>RFC8100 recommends preserving the notion of end-to-end service

         standard PHBs at interconnection.  The key requirement is that the DSCP at the
         network ingress is restored at the network egress.  The current version of
         RFC8100 limits the number of DSCPs to 6 and 3 more are suggested for extension.
         RFC8100 respects the deployment of PHB groups for DS domain internal use, which
         limits the number of acceptable external DSCPs (and possibilities for their
         transparent transport or restoration at network boundaries).  In this design,
         packets marked with DSCPs not part of the RFC8100 codepoint scheme are treated
         as unexpected and will possibly be remarked (a /Remark/ behaviour) or dealt
         with via an additional agreement(s) among the operators of the interconnected
         networks.  RFC8100 can be extended to support up to 32 DSCPs by future
         standards. RFC8100 is operated by at least one Tier 1 backbone provider.  Use
         of the MPLS Short Pipe Model favours remarking unexpected DSCP values to zero
         in the absence of an additional agreement(s), as explained in <xref
         target="RFC8100"></xref>. This can result in bleaching (/Bleach/).

        <t>Mobile LTE and 5G standards have evolved from older UMTS standards,
        and support DiffServ. LTE (4G) and 5G standards <xref
        target="SA-5G"></xref> identify traffic classes at the interface
        between User Equipment (UE) and the mobile Packet Core network by QCI
        (QoS Class Identifiers) and 5QI (5G QoS Identifier). The 3GPP
        standards do not define or recommend any specific mapping between
        each QCI or 5QI and DiffServ (and mobile QCIs are based on several
        criteria service class definitions). The way packets are mapped at the
        Packet Gateway (P-GW) boundary is determined by operators. However, TS
        23.107 (version 16.0.0, applies to LTE and below) mandates that
        Differentiated Services, defined by IETF, shall be used to
        interoperate with IP backbone networks.</t>

        <t>The GSM Association (GSMA) has defined four aggregated classes and
        seven associated PHBs in their guidelines for IPX Provider networks
        <xref target="GSMA-IR-34">GSMA IR.34</xref>. 
This was previously specified as the Inter-Service Provider IP Backbone Guidelines, and provides a mobile ISP to ISP QoS mapping mechanism, and interconnection with other IP networks in the general Internet. If realised by an IP VPN, the operator is free to apply its DS Domain internal codepoint scheme at outer headers and inner IPX DSCPs may be transported transparently. The guidelines also describe a case where the DSCP marking from a Service Provider cannot be trusted (depending on the agreement between the Service Provider and its IPX Provider), in which situation the IPX Provider can remark the DSCP value to a static default value.

    <section title="Considerations for DSCP Selection">
      <t>This section provides advice for the assignment of a new DSCP value.
        It is intended to aid the IETF and IESG in considering a request for a new DSCP.
      The section identifies known issues that might influence the finally assigned
      DSCP, and provides a summary of considerations for assignment of a new
      DSCP.</t>

      <section title="Effect of Bleaching and Remarking to a single DSCP">
        <t>Section 4 describes remarking of the DSCP.
	New DSCP assignments should consider the impact of bleaching
  	(/Bleach/) or remarking (/Remark/) to a single DSCP, which can limit
   	the ability to provide the expected treatment end-to-end.  This is
   	particularly important for cases where the codepoint is intended to
  	result in lower than best effort treatment, as was the case when
  	defining the LE PHB <xref target="RFC8622"></xref>.
  	Forwarding LE using the default PHB is in line with RFC8622, but
   	it is recommended to maintain the distinct LE DSCP codepoint 
  	end-to-end to allow for differentiated treatment by 
   	domains supporting LE. Rewriting the LE DSCP to the default class (CS0)
   	results in an undesired promotion of the priority for LE traffic in such a domain.
   	Bleaching the lower three bits of the DSCP (/Bleach-low/
   	and /Bleach-some-low/), as well as remarking to a particular 
  	 DSCP can result in similar changes of priority relative to traffic that is marked with other DSCPs.
	 </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Where the proposed DSCP &gt; 0x07 (7)">
        <t>Although the IETF specifications require systems to use DSCP
        marking semantics in place of methods based on the former ToS field,
        the current recommendation is that any new assignment where the
        DSCP is greater than 0x07 should consider the semantics
        associated with the resulting DSCP when ToS Precedence Bleaching (/Bleach-ToS-Precedence/ and /Bleach-some-ToS/)
	or ToS Precedence Remarking (/Remark-ToS/) is
        experienced. For example, it can be desirable to avoid choosing a DSCP
        that could be remarked to LE, <xref target="RFC8622">Lower
        Effort</xref>, which could otherwise potentially result in a priority
        inversion in the treatment.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Where the proposed DSCP &lt; 0x07 (7)">
        <t>ToS Precedence Bleaching or ToS Precedence Remarking can unintentionally result in extra traffic
        aggregated to the same DSCP. For example, after experiencing ToS Precedence
        Bleaching, all traffic marked AF11, AF21, AF31 and AF41 would be
        aggregated with traffic marked with DSCP 2 (0x02), increasing the
        volume of traffic which receives the treatment associated with DSCP 2.
        New DSCP assignments should consider unexpected
        consequences arising from this observed remarking behaviour.</t>
	 
        <section title="Where the proposed DSCP&amp;0x07=0x01">
          <t>As a consequence of assigning the LE PHB <xref
          target="RFC8622"></xref>, the IETF allocated the DSCP 0b000001 from
          Pool 3.</t>

          <t>When making assignments where the DSCP has a format: 0bxxx001,
          the case of ToS Precedence Bleaching (/Bleach-ToS-Precedence/) of a
          DSCP to a value of 0x01 needs to be considered. ToS Precedence
          Bleaching will result in demoting the traffic to the lower effort
          traffic class. Care should be taken to consider the implications
	  of remarking
          when choosing to  assign a DSCP with this format.</t>
        </section>

      </section>

      <section anchor= "networks" title="Impact on deployed infrastructure">
        <t>Behaviour of deployed PHBs and conditioning treatments also needs
        to be considered when assigning a new DSCP. Network operators have choices
        when it comes to configuring DiffServ support within their domains, and the observed remarking behaviours 
	described in the previous section can result from different configurations 
	and approaches:</t>
        <t><list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="Networks not remarking DiffServ:"> A network that either does not implement PHBs, or 
		    implements one or more PHBs whilst restoring the DSCP field at network egress with the value 
		    at network ingress. Operators in this category pass all DSCPs transparently.</t>
            <t hangText="Networks that condition the DSCP:"> A network that implements more than one PHB and enforces 
	Service Level Agreements (SLAs) with its peers. Operators in this category use conditioning to ensure that
        only traffic that matches a policy is permitted to use a specific DSCP (see <xref target="RFC8100"></xref>). 
	Operators need to either map the new DSCP to a corresponding PHB or remark the DSCP to a value 
		    appropriate for the domain's deployed DiffServ infrastructure.</t>
		
            <t hangText="Networks that remark in some other way">, which includes: 
            </t>
                <t><list style='numbers'>
                <t>Networks containing misconfigured devices that do not comply with the relevant RFCs.</t>
                <t>Networks containing devices that implement an obsolete specification or contain software bugs.</t>
                <t>Networks containing devices that remark the DSCP as a result of lower layer interactions.</t>
		</list></t>
       </list></t>
      <t>
	The DSCP re-marking corresponding to the ToS Precedence Bleaching (/Bleach-ToS-Precedence/) 
	observed behaviour described in section 4 can arise for various reasons, one of which is old equipment which precedes DiffServ.
The same remarking can also arise in some cases when traffic conditioning is
provided by DiffServ routers at operator boundaries, or as a result
of misconfiguration.

      <section title="Considerations to guide the discussion of a proposed new DSCP">

        <t>A series of questions emerge that need to be answered when
        considering a proposal to the IETF that requests a new assignment.
        These questions include:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">		
            <t>Is the request for local use within a DiffServ domain that does not require
	    interconnection with other DiffServ domains? This request can use DSCPs in Pool 2 for local or
            experimental use, without any IETF specification for the DSCP or
            associated PHB.</t>

	    <t>How is the proposed service class characterised: What are the
            characteristics of the traffic to be carried? What are the
            expectations for treatment? </t>

            <t>Service classes <xref target="RFC4594"></xref> that can utilise existing PHBs should use
            assigned DSCPs to mark their traffic: Could the request be met by
            using an existing IETF DSCP?</t>
		
   	   <t>Specification of a new recommended DSCP requires Standards Action.
        RFC2474 states: "Each standardized PHB MUST have an associated
        RECOMMENDED codepoint". If approved, new IETF assignments are normally
        made by IANA in Pool 1, but the IETF can request assignments to be
        made from Pool 3 <xref target="RFC8436"></xref>. Does the ID contain an appropriate request to IANA?</t>

            <t>The value selected for a new DSCP can impact the ability of an operator to apply
		    logical functions (e.g., a bitwise mask) to related codepoints when configuring DiffServ.
		    A suitable value can simplify configurations by
		    aggregating classification on a range of DSCPs. This can
		    also increase the comprehensibilty of documenting forwarding differentiaton.</t>
	     <t>    
		    <xref target="mpls"></xref> describes examples of treatment aggregation. What are the effects of treatment aggregation on the
            proposed DSCP? </t>

            <t> <xref target="lowerlayers"></xref> describes some observed treatments by layers
            below IP. What are the implications of the treatments and mapping described in <xref target="lowerlayers"></xref> on the proposed DSCP? </t>
		   
            <t> DSCPs are assigned to PHBs and can be used to enable nodes along an end-to-end path to classify the packet for a suitable PHB. <xref target="observed-remarking"></xref> describes some observed remarking behaviour, and <xref target="networks"></xref> identifies root causes for why this remarking is observed. 
		    What is the expected effect of currently-deployed remarking on the service, end-to-end or otherwise?</t>
